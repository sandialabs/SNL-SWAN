Project Overview
====================
`SNL-SWAN <https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/SNL-SWAN>`_ is a modification of the open source `SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) <http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net/>`_ code developed by `TU Delft <http://www.swan.tudelft.nl/>`_. Development and application of the SNL-SWAN code is led by Sandia National Laboratories with the support of many external collaborators. The SNL-SWAN code includes the addition of a WEC Module which improves how SWAN accounts for power performance of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) and their affect on the wave field.
